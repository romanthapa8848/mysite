    <div class="post-content"><p>Let’s talk about something that’s been on my mind for a while now—<strong>web development</strong> and <strong>computer engineering</strong> jobs are booming in Nepal, while <strong>civil engineering</strong> often feels like it’s just not paying enough for the amount of effort we put in. 🏗️💸</p>
<p>I learned this firsthand. A few months ago, I worked as a civil engineer at a construction company for 3 months. In that time, I earned just <strong>20,000 NPR</strong>. You read that right—20,000 NPR over the span of 12 weeks. To make matters worse, that was actually less than what the drivers at the company were earning. Despite the long hours, physical labor, and all the stress of the job, the financial reward didn’t add up. 😤</p>
<p>Then, I decided to try something new—<strong>web development</strong>. I started as a freelancer, and here’s where things got interesting. In my first week working on a website, I made <strong>10,000 NPR</strong>. For my second project, I earned <strong>15,000 NPR</strong>—all in the span of just one week. 💻💰</p>
<p>Let me put that into perspective for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a civil engineer, in <strong>12 weeks</strong> (3 months), I made <strong>20,000 NPR</strong>.</li>
<li>As a freelance web developer, in just <strong>2 weeks</strong>, I earned <strong>25,000 NPR</strong> (10,000 + 15,000).</li>
</ul>
<p>So why the big difference? 🤔</p>
<h3 id="1-global-demand-for-tech-skills-">1. Global Demand for Tech Skills 🌍</h3>
<p>The digital world is exploding. The demand for <strong>web developers</strong>, <strong>programmers</strong>, and <strong>tech professionals</strong> is global. Opportunities are everywhere—especially for those who know how to code. On the flip side, civil engineering is crucial for local development, but the opportunities are often more limited to specific markets. In Nepal, it feels like civil engineering is saturated and growth is slow.</p>
<h3 id="2-lower-entry-barriers-for-tech-">2. Lower Entry Barriers for Tech 🔑</h3>
<p>Web development has a much lower entry barrier. You don’t need a fancy degree or years of experience to start building websites or apps. There are so many affordable online resources, and anyone with a passion for coding can dive in. Civil engineering? That requires years of formal education, certifications, and field experience, which can make it harder to break into and much slower to see financial rewards.</p>
<h3 id="3-supply-and-demand-">3. Supply and Demand 📉📈</h3>
<p>In tech, the demand for skilled workers is sky-high, but the supply of skilled developers is still growing. This imbalance drives up salaries. In civil engineering, though, the demand for engineers is slower, and many engineers are fighting for a limited number of projects, which keeps wages down.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line-">The Bottom Line 💡</h2>
<p>While civil engineering is essential for building the infrastructure that keeps society running, <strong>web development</strong> offers immediate financial rewards, flexibility, and more growth opportunities right now. If you’re looking to upskill or make a career change, the <strong>tech industry</strong> is where the action is. 🚀</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that civil engineering isn’t important or rewarding in its own right, but the financial reality of the job market in Nepal right now is that tech jobs are paying a lot more for less time and effort. For me, the numbers don’t lie.</p>
