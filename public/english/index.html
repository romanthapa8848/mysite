<h2><a href="/english/engineering/is-civil-engineering-in-nepal-worth-it-heres-what-ive-learned-from-experience/">Is Civil Engineering in Nepal Worth It? Here’s What I’ve Learned from Experience 🤔</a></h2>
<p>Having worked in the construction sector in Nepal, particularly in the Nawalpur district, I’ve had a firsthand look at the realities of civil engineering in the country. While many young Nepali students consider civil engineering as a solid career choice, I believe it’s important to be aware of some harsh truths before diving in. 🚧</p>
<h3 id="1-corruption-and-favoritism-">1. Corruption and Favoritism 💸</h3>
<p>One of the most disheartening aspects I’ve witnessed in the construction industry is how much it’s driven by connections rather than qualifications. I’ve seen students with backlogs landing jobs simply because their relatives own construction companies, while the top students with outstanding academic records are left struggling to find meaningful employment. It’s a tough pill to swallow when hard work and dedication don’t always guarantee success. 😔</p> 
<h2><a href="/english/ai/why-everyone-should-blog-in-the-age-of-ai/">Why Everyone Should Blog in the Age of AI 🤖✍️</a></h2>
<p>In a world increasingly driven by Artificial Intelligence, blogging might seem like an old-school idea—but it’s more relevant than ever! Whether you’re a student, a professional, or just someone with a passion, blogging is a powerful tool to amplify your voice, establish your presence, and even future-proof yourself in this AI-dominated era. Here’s why everyone should start blogging in the age of AI (yes, including YOU!). 🚀</p>

<h2 id="1-your-unique-voice-matters-">1. Your Unique Voice Matters 🎤</h2>
<p>AI can churn out articles, but it lacks authenticity and the human touch. People crave stories, emotions, and perspectives that only you can offer. Blogging allows you to share your real experiences, ideas, and creativity in a way that no algorithm can replicate.</p> 
<h2><a href="/english/engineering/why-pursuing-engineering-in-private-colleges-in-kathmandu-is-a-big-no/">Why Pursuing Engineering in Private Colleges in Kathmandu is a BIG NO! 🚨</a></h2>
<p>💡&ldquo;Monkey sees, monkey does&rdquo; – Your environment shapes who you become. And trust me, if you’re considering private engineering colleges and hostels in Kathmandu, you might want to think twice. Here’s why I strongly believe they are a huge mistake:</p>
<h3 id="-private-colleges-the-harsh-truth">🚩 Private Colleges: The Harsh Truth</h3>
<h4 id="1-subpar-academic-environment-">1. Subpar Academic Environment 📚</h4>
<p>One of the first things I noticed in private engineering colleges is the lack of a serious academic mindset. Many students don’t treat their education with the respect it deserves, and this mediocrity will rub off on you too. If the people around you aren’t motivated, it’s hard to stay focused.</p>  </main>
