Having worked in the construction sector in Nepal, particularly in the Nawalpur district, I’ve had a firsthand look at the realities of civil engineering in the country. While many young Nepali students consider civil engineering as a solid career choice, I believe it’s important to be aware of some harsh truths before diving in. 🚧

### 1. Corruption and Favoritism 💸

One of the most disheartening aspects I’ve witnessed in the construction industry is how much it’s driven by connections rather than qualifications. I’ve seen students with backlogs landing jobs simply because their relatives own construction companies, while the top students with outstanding academic records are left struggling to find meaningful employment. It’s a tough pill to swallow when hard work and dedication don’t always guarantee success. 😔

### 2. Localized and Limited Opportunities 🌍

Civil engineering, unlike fields such as IT or computer engineering, is deeply tied to physical locations and infrastructure. The opportunities are localized, meaning you’ll likely need to work within specific regions. If you dream of a career that allows you to travel or work globally, civil engineering in Nepal might not offer that flexibility. In contrast, IT professionals can work from anywhere with just a laptop and an internet connection, allowing them to make a broader, global impact. 🌐

### 3. Lack of Practical Training 🔧

Another issue I’ve observed is the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical experience. Private colleges in Nepal can charge up to 15 lakhs for an education, but most students graduate with little hands-on experience. The equipment needed for practical training is often lacking, and the focus remains on textbooks and theory. This leaves graduates unprepared for the real-world challenges they will face in the field. 📚

### 4. Exploitation and Low Pay 💼

After months of grueling work, fresh graduates in civil engineering often end up with salaries as low as Rs. 20,000 per month. This is hard to accept, especially when you compare it to fields like IT, where you can freelance, build websites, develop apps, and potentially earn much more—often with greater independence and flexibility. 💻

### 🎯 My Take on Civil Engineering in Nepal

Unless you have strong family connections in the construction business or are particularly passionate about working in the local construction sector, I believe civil engineering in Nepal offers a poor return on investment. For young students looking for global opportunities, fair pay, and the chance to be their own boss, fields like IT or computer engineering offer far better prospects. 💡

### 💡 Why IT Might Be a Better Path

The beauty of IT is that you can learn essential skills online, start your own business, or even disrupt markets. Whether you choose to build websites, develop software, or work as a freelancer, the opportunities are vast and flexible. Unlike civil engineering, which is constrained by physical infrastructure, IT allows you to be mobile, innovative, and reach a global audience. 🚀

### ❌ Don’t Let Tradition or Societal Pressure Decide for You

In Nepali society, there’s often a pressure to follow traditional career paths like engineering. But it’s essential to make a decision based on your personal goals and aspirations. Don’t let societal expectations push you into a field that doesn’t align with your ambitions, especially when there are other paths—like IT—that offer more flexibility, higher pay, and global reach. 🌟

I hope my experiences give you a clearer picture of what to expect. If you’re considering civil engineering in Nepal, think carefully about whether it aligns with your personal goals. There are many other exciting and lucrative paths out there waiting for you. 🌱
