💡"Monkey sees, monkey does" – Your environment shapes who you become. And trust me, if you’re considering private engineering colleges and hostels in Kathmandu, you might want to think twice. Here’s why I strongly believe they are a huge mistake:

### 🚩 Private Colleges: The Harsh Truth

#### 1. Subpar Academic Environment 📚

One of the first things I noticed in private engineering colleges is the lack of a serious academic mindset. Many students don’t treat their education with the respect it deserves, and this mediocrity will rub off on you too. If the people around you aren’t motivated, it’s hard to stay focused.

#### 2. Drug Hub Culture 🚬

Let’s face it—private colleges are often known for more than just academics. You’ll find drug deals happening in the toilets and hallways, and it’s a sad reality that many students get sucked into this toxic environment. It's not the place you want to be if you have any aspirations to succeed.

#### 3. Lazy Teachers, Lazy Students 😴

Private colleges often see you as an ATM rather than a student. The teachers lack passion, and the guidance you need to succeed is practically non-existent. You’ll feel like you’re on your own, surrounded by a culture of mediocrity.

#### 4. Wasted Years ⏳

You might think you’re saving time by enrolling in a private college instead of waiting for a seat in a government institution like Pulchowk or Thapathali. But trust me, you’re losing more than just time. After four years, you’ll end up trying to fix all the mistakes, and you’ll be stuck for even longer.

### 🏚️ Hostels: A Nightmare

#### 1. Toxic Environment 🏚️

Hostels are often shared with people who have zero ambition, including drug addicts and thieves. Living in such an environment is mentally draining, and it can negatively impact your mindset and focus.

#### 2. Constant Loss 🧳

Living in a hostel means you’ll probably lose your clothes, valuables, and peace of mind. I’ve experienced it myself, and the constant thefts can be exhausting.

#### 3. Health Issues 🍲

The food in hostels is often terrible, and the hygiene standards are even worse. This can lead to serious health issues, particularly digestive problems, which could stay with you for years.

#### 4. Missed Life Lessons 🥘

In a hostel, you miss out on important life skills—like cooking your own food, managing your space, and being self-reliant. These are lessons that will serve you well in the future, but they’re overlooked when you’re stuck in a hostel.

### ✅ What Should You Do Instead?

If you’re serious about pursuing engineering, don’t settle for anything less than the best. Aim for top-tier institutions like Pulchowk or Thapathali Engineering Campus. Yes, it might take 2–3 years longer to get in, but trust me, it’s worth it in the long run.

Instead of living in a hostel, rent a room and learn to cook your own food. Not only will you save yourself from the hostel drama, but you’ll also become more independent, healthier, and better prepared for the challenges ahead.

### 🚀 Conclusion: Build Your Foundation Strong

Don’t let a poor environment limit your potential. A strong academic and personal foundation is the key to a successful future, and you deserve the best. Share this post to help others avoid the same mistakes I made, and take control of your future today.

I hope this post helps you make an informed decision! If you're serious about your engineering career, don’t compromise on your environment or your education. You’ve got this! 💪
